								<h2>Android App Implementation</a></h2>

							<span class="image main"><img src="../images/Apian Resources/App Iterations.png" alt="" class="iterationsBg" /></span>
							<h2>App Requirements</h2>
							<p>The mobile application is a fundamental component of our solution. Therefore, before we even started working on its
								implementation, we had to make sure that its requirements were very well established:
							</p>
							<ul>
								<li>
									<h3>P0 (Essential product features - cannot launch without them):</h3>
									<ol>
										<li>The app must be able to detect nearby Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) devices along with their MAC-addresses
											and relative signal strength indicator value (RSSI) which is a measure of how close a beacon is to a phone.
										</li>
										<li>
											The app must be able to transmit all beacons detected to the web-application, so that porters can be tracked.
										</li>
										<li>
											The app must allow a porter (user) to respond to delivery requests made. 
										</li>
										<li>
											The app must allow a porter to indicate that they have completed a delivery.
										</li>
										<li>
											The app must be easy to use for porters so that their daily tasks are not slowed down by trying to navigate it.
										</li>
										<li>
											The app must be able to be re-used on the same device by multiple porters with distinct identities, to enable
											re-usability of NHS work phones.
										</li>
									</ol>
								</li>
								<li>
									<h3>P1 (Important product features):</h3>
									<ol>
										<li>
											The app should allow porters to login to the hospital servers securely with their credentials.
										</li>
										<li>
											The app should authenticate users who successfully login, to ensure that they are real porters.
										</li>
										<li>
											The app should allow porters to indicate their availability to fulfill delivery requests throughout
											the day.
										</li>
										<li>
											The app should be exported as an APK file with Apian branding so it looks professional.
										</li>
										<li>
											The app should allow porters to stay logged in by caching their login details, so they don't have to
											login again every time it is launched.
										</li>
										<li>
											The app should allow porters to log out, so it can be re-used on the same device by other porters.
										</li>
										<li>
											The app should scan in the background for BLE beacons and transmit them to the backend, without the screen
											having to be switched on.
										</li>
									</ol>
								</li>
								<li>
									<h3>P2 (Nice to have product features, but the first launch can be made without them):</h3>
									<ol>
										<li>
											The app could display the latest request made along with the delivery locations that need to be reached
										</li>
										<li>
											The app could trigger a notification every time a request is made.
										</li>
									</ol>
								</li>
							</ul>
							<h2>Team Background</h2>
							<p>As mentioned previously, the mobile application is a core requirement of our project set out by Apian. Unfortunately, prior
								to this project, no one from the team had experience building mobile applications, so our project partners suggested that
								we design an Android app solution, and pointed out various resources that we could use to get started on our implementation.
							</p>
							<h2>Initial Approach</h2>
							<p>The first step was to successfully implement a foundational part of our Android application, which was the ability to scan for
								BLE devices. This was a difficult task to implement, as we were just getting used to the Android environment and were still
								learning how fragments, activities and services interact in the Android development ecosystem.
								<br/>
								Another obstacle that we had to overcome was that a lot of resources and tutorials that we found online on BLE scanning,
								provided classes and methods that were deprecated, so in the end we also had to implement our own version of a method to
								deal with BLE scanning callbacks.
								<br/>
								After many hours of time and effort, we had our first sample application, which was just a single-fragment app that scanned
								for and displayed the nearest Bluetooth devices (including BLE beacons) along with their MAC addresses:
							</p>
							<span class="image main"><img src="../images/First App Implementation.png" alt="" class="iterationBg" />
								<p class="description">Figure 1: First app implementation, allows user to start and stop scanning for BLE devices. Also able to
									distinguish and filter between BLE beacons and regular Bluetooth devices.
								</p>
							</span>
							<p>The first implementation provided a great learning experience and an important step towards designing the desired product.</p>
							<h2>Next Steps: Fulfilling Core App Requirements</h2>
							<p>
								After presenting the initial prototype to our clients in one of our weekly meetings and obtaining positive feedback from them,
								we felt confident moving onto the next step, which was to tick off some other essential requirements <b>(P0)</b> of our application, such
								as <b>(1) allowing porters to respond to requests</b> and <b>(2) identify themselves while using the app.</b>
