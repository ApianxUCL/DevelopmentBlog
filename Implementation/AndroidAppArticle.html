								<h2>Android App Implementation</a></h2>

							</header>
							<span class="image main"><img src="../images/Apian Resources/App Iterations.png" alt="" class="iterationsBg" /></span>
							<h2>App Requirements</h2>
							<p>The mobile application is a fundamental component of our solution. Therefore, before we even started working on its
								implementation, we had to make sure that its requirements were very well established:
							</p>
							<div class="implementation-container">
								<div class="feature-container">
									<h3>P0 (Essential product features - cannot launch without them):</h3>
									<ul>
									<li>The app must be able to detect nearby Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) devices along with their MAC-addresses and relative signal strength indicator value (RSSI) which is a measure of how close a beacon is to a phone.</li>
									<li>The app must be able to transmit all beacons detected to the web-application, so that porters can be tracked.</li>
									<li>The app must allow a porter (user) to respond to delivery requests made.</li>
									<li>The app must allow a porter to indicate that they have completed a delivery.</li>
									<li>The app must be easy to use for porters so that their daily tasks are not slowed down by trying to navigate it.</li>
									<li>The app must be able to be re-used on the same device by multiple porters with distinct identities, to enable re-usability of NHS work phones.</li>
									</ul>
								</div>
								
								<div class="feature-container" style="display:none;">
									<h3>P1 (Important product features):</h3>
									<ul>
									<li>The app should allow porters to login to the hospital servers securely with their credentials.</li>
									<li>The app should authenticate users who successfully login, to ensure that they are real porters.</li>
									<li>The app should allow porters to indicate their availability to fulfill delivery requests throughout the day.</li>
									<li>The app should be exported as an APK file with Apian branding so it looks professional.</li>
									<li>The app should allow porters to stay logged in by caching their login details, so they don't have to login again every time it is launched.</li>
									<li>The app should allow porters to log out, so it can be re-used on the same device by other porters.</li>
									<li>The app should scan in the background for BLE beacons and transmit them to the backend, without the screen having to be switched on.</li>
									</ul>
								</div>
								
								<div class="feature-container" style="display:none;">
									<h3>P2 (Nice to have product features, but the first launch can be made without them):</h3>
									<ul>
									<li>The app could display the latest request made along with the delivery locations that need to be reached</li>
									<li>The app could trigger a notification every time a request is made.</li>
									</ul>
								</div>
								<div class="buttons-container">
									<button class="prev-btn">&#9650;</button>
									<button class="next-btn">&#9660;</button>
								</div>

							<h2>Team Background</h2>
							<p>As mentioned previously, the mobile application is a core requirement of our project set out by Apian. Unfortunately, prior
								to this project, no one from the team had experience building mobile applications, so our project partners suggested that
								we design an Android app solution, and pointed out various resources that we could use to get started on our implementation,
								including Android Developers and LinkedIn Learning.
							</p>
							<h2>Initial Approach</h2>
							<p>The first step was to successfully implement a foundational part of our Android application, which was the ability to scan for
								BLE devices. This was a difficult task to implement, as we were just getting used to the Android environment and were still
								learning how fragments, activities and services interact in the Android development ecosystem.
								<br/>
								Another obstacle that we had to overcome was that a lot of resources and tutorials that we found online on BLE scanning,
								provided classes and methods that were deprecated, so in the end we also had to implement our own version of a method to
								deal with BLE scanning callbacks.
								<br/>
								After many hours of time and effort, we had our first sample application, which was just a single-fragment app that scanned
								for and displayed the nearest Bluetooth devices (including BLE beacons) along with their MAC addresses:
							</p>
							<span class="image main"><img src="../images/First App Implementation.png" alt="" class="iterationBg" />
								<p class="description">Figure 1: First app implementation, allows user to start and stop scanning for BLE devices. Also able to
									distinguish and filter between BLE beacons and regular Bluetooth devices.
								</p>
							</span>
							<p>The first implementation provided a great learning experience and an important step towards designing the desired product.</p>
							<h2>Next Steps: Fulfilling Other Core App Requirements</h2>
							<p>
								After presenting the initial prototype to our clients in one of our weekly meetings and obtaining positive feedback from them,
								we felt confident moving onto the next step, which was to tick off some other essential requirements <b>(P0)</b> of our application, such
								as <b>(1) allowing porters to respond to requests</b> and <b>(2) identify themselves while using the app.</b>
							</p>
							<h3>Requirement 1: Allowing porters to respond to requests</h3>
							<p>
								The main task at hand here was to decide via which method porters would communicate with our web application. The obvious choice in this
								case would be to use some form of HTTP-based communications.<br/>
								However, after discussing this with our clients, we were able to obtain some very valuable insights about why using SMS-based communication
								instead for a start, could be much more practical:
								<ul>
									<li>Firstly, when considering the way requests are currently fulfilled by porters, we observed that this is done using SMS devices
										called pagers. Thus, moving forward with an SMS-based solution would make product adoption smoother.
									</li>
									<li>
										Another key consideration we observed was that not every corner of a hospital has strong enough bandwidth and thus, HTTP requests
										may not deliver in such scenarios where hospital basements or remote locations experience poor connectivity. This also makes
										our solution more scalable as it could be even adopted in hospitals located in rural or underdeveloped regions where internet
										infrastructure is limited.
									</li>
									<li>
										One of, if not the most important consideration, that needs to be made when designing a product to be used in hospitals, is how
										well that product responds to emergencies. Our solution must be robust and efficient. This is something we took very seriously as
										a team, and through research we found that <b>"Just 15% of hospitals across UK are on the official 'protected sites' list, meaning they
										would qualify for power during a national blackout."</b><sub>[1]</sub> As a result, we need to design a solution that can respond to situations where
										power - through backup generators for example, may be very limited and can only be used to power essential equipment, leaving hospitals
										without any bandwidth. Furthermore, this doesn't just apply to the very rare cases of national power outages, as we also observed that,
										last year during winter, hospitals had to make emergency plans in response to limited gas supplies and winter power loss fears.<sub>[2]</sub>
									</li>
								</ul>
								At the same time, we also acknowledge that SMS communication is not the most secure method we could use to interact with porters. This is because,
								SMS messages are not encrypted by default <sub>[3]</sub> which means that any sensitive information, such as medical records or personal details, could potentially
								be intercepted by malicious third parties. This would pose a significant security risk for hospitals. In contrast, a HTTP-based communication
								channel, like Firebase Messaging, offers a range of encryption and security options which can protect sensitive patient data. Firebase messaging uses
								end-to-end encryption to secure messages in transit, which means that messages are encrypted from the sender to the recipient, ensuring that each request
								will only be directed to and read by the intended porter.
								<br/>
								<br/>
								<b>To conclude our case study,</b> we decided that the first implementations of our solution would make use of SMS responses handled by a central Twilio
								service, and moving forward, we would migrate this service to a Firebase Messaging implementation, keeping SMS as the fallback system in case of emergencies
								causing network or power disruptions, ensuring that delivery requests can still be received and processed promptly. We felt that this was the right way to
								move forward, as most hospitals in the UK have the power capability and technology infrastructure to benefit from a web-centred solution which can provide
								significant improvements in request efficiency, potentially saving human lives.
							</p>
							<h3>Requirement 2: Allowing porters to identify themselves</h3>
							<p>
								Whilst we acknowledge that UK hospitals have access to significant technology, we recognize the importance of minimizing excess technology and redirecting
								funds to invest in more critical equipment. With this consideration in mind, we believe hospitals should only provide enough devices to cover the maximum
								number of porters on shift at the same time, rather than investing in one work phone for each porter. By allowing porters to reuse the phones with a unique
								identity on our app, we can reduce excess technology and save funds for more critical equipment.
							</p>
							<h3>Implementing requirements 1 & 2</h3>
							<p>
								To design our application, we followed an iterative design approach. We felt that this would be the right approach as we were fortunate enough to participate
								in weekly meetings with our client, where we coult obtain constructive criticism on our solutions and iterate over them until we reach a product that both
								parites were happy with. As you can observe below in Figure 2, our first iteration involved a name box for porters to enter their name and press 'Submit' to
								validate their identity. Furthermore, the three buttons observed in the bottom half of the screen each triggered a unique message that was interpreted
								by our Twilio SMS service to determine what a porter had responded to the delivery request. This implementation also made it easy to fulfill another core
								requirement (P0) which stated: " The app must allow a porter to indicate that they have completed a delivery. " This was easily achieved by adding a 'Delivery
								Complete' button with the same functionality as the 'Accept' and 'Reject' buttons.
							</p>
							<span class="image main"><img src="../images/Second App Implementation.png" alt="" class="iterationBg" />
								<p class="description">Figure 2: Second app implementation, allows user to identify themselves via the name text box, whereby the submit button verifies
									that the name corresponds to a valid porter name in the backend. Each button in the bottom of the screen triggers a different SMS message sent to our
									Twilio phone number.
								</p>
							</span>
							<p>
								To further explain the functionality of the 'sendSMS' Kotlin function above, firstly, a PendingIntent object was created. A PendingIntent is essentially a token
								that is used when an external function is called (in this case a function of the SMSManager class) which allows a user to be notified as to whether the function was
								successful. In our case, the Pending Intent was passed onto the function 'sendTextMessage' which obtained an instance of the mobile phone's SMS Manager to send a
								text message. Having objects like the intent described above, made testing the application much easier for us.
								<br/><br/>
								For this initial iteration, the way a porter was verified was through a <b>HTTP POST</b> to the backend that was triggered every time a user clicked on 'Submit'.
								The HTTP response code of this POST was observed, and if the relevant code was received, i.e. verification was successful, a pop-up message welcoming the user was
								displayed. If the verification was unsuccessful, a pop-up message informing the user of this was displayed, and the messages including beacon info that were transmitted
								to the backend would be ignored.
								<br/>
								This implementation also fulfilled another core requirement (P0): "The app must be able to be re-used on the same device by multiple porters with distinct identities, to enable
								re-usability of NHS work phones." However, this was only the initial step into getting a porter verified and we knew we could improve a lot in this scenario.
							</p>
							<h3>Implementing final core requirements</h3>
							<p>
								By this stage, the only core requirements that were left to fulfill were transmitting identified Bluetooth beacons to the backend, whilst also keeping the app simple to use, so
								it doesn't slow down porters trying to navigate it.
								<br/><br/>
								Since beacon data would be transmitted via HTTP POST, it was crucial for us to limit the number of requests sent to the backend, so as to keep server traffic low and enhance
								performance, which in turn would mean porters can receive and respond to requests swiftly. A naive approach would be to send a HTTP request whenever a beacon was identified,
								however this raises two great concerns:
								<ol>
									<li>A phone that is constantly scanning for BLE beacons is likely to pick up multiple Bluetooth devices per second, especially in a hospital setting where there are thousands of
										specialised equipment. As a result, the aforementioned implementation would lead to multiple HTTP requests sent per second, creating unecessary web traffic.
									</li>
									<li>
										If the signal strength picked up by a specific beacon changes, then that is considered a new scan result, so a phone could potentially transmit the same beacon multiple times
										within a few seconds if a user keeps walking around; which is very much the case for porters who have to move constantly around a hospital to fulfill deliveries.
									</li>
								</ol>
								To avoid these concerns, firstly we had to decide how often we would need to update a porter's location. Given that the average walking speed for adults is less than 1.4 m/s <sub>[4]</sub> , we
								decided that updating porters' positions every 5 seconds would be more than satisfactory for the purposes of our project. To do this, we created a Runnable object in our
								Android application, which would be executed every 5 seconds as a background process, so it doesn't interfere with the main UI thread, which would send a HTTP POST of all
								beacons detected within that timeframe. 
								<br/><br/>
								Our next concern revolved around potential duplicate scan results, upon change in beacon signal strength. To overcome this, we stored detected beacons inside a HashMap, where
								the key was a beacon's MAC-Address. As a result, whenever a beacon that was already in the HashMap was detected, its value was overwitten by the latest entry. This HashMap also
								acted as a buffer to hold beacons detected for 5 seconds, and was emptied whenever its contents were transmitted.
								<br/>
								A more technical explanation with snippets of code can be observed below in Figure 3:
							</p>
							<span class="image main"><img src="../images/Sending Beacons.png" alt="" class="iterationBg" />
								<p class="description">Figure 3: Description of how beacons are identified and transmitted to the backend.
								</p>
							</span>
							<p>
								With this implementation, we had also ticked off our final P0 requirement, which aimed to make the experience of using the app straightforward for porters. All they have
								to do is enter their name, click on the scan button to start tracking themselves, and respond to requests by clicking the buttons in the bottom-half of the screen. Overall,
								all core app requirements had been completed at this stage.
							</p>
							<h2>Separation of Concerns</h2>
							<p>
								After informing our clients that we had met the core app requirements that were essential for the first launch, we then looked to iterate over our current
								implementation to make it more robust whilst also implementing other important (P1) features.
							</p>
							<h3>Login Screen</h3>
							<span class="image main"><img src="../images/Login Iterations.png" alt="" class="iterationBg" />
								<p class="description">Figure 4: Login screen iterations.
								</p>
							</span>
							<p>
								The most obvious improvement which could be made based on our previous implementations was the login functionality, which was not up to industry standards. Especially when it
								comes to hospitals, privacy is key; hospital records should be kept confidential, and no one should be able to pretend that they are a porter.
								<br/><br/>
								As a result, we created a new Login Fragment, which would act as a page allowing porters to login and verify themselves before being allowed to perform other work-related
								operations. This fragment was supported by the Login template provided in Android Studio, which allowed us to create a robust login functionality, with a LoginViewModel class
								to handle data input by the user through the fragment, and would make the relevant requests to the server to authenticate a user through the LoginDataSource class. The UML diagram
								for the login functionality can be found below:
							</p>
							<span class="image main"><img src="../images/Login Iterations.png" alt="" class="iterationBg" />
								<p class="description">Figure 5: Unified Modelling Language (UML) diagram overview of Login functionality.
								</p>
							</span>
							<p>
								As you can observe, there are a lot of functions such as onCreateView, onViewCreated, onDestroyView etc. These are some fundamental functions which run during the lifecycle
								of a fragment. For further clarification as to what each function does in a fragment's lifecycle, please refer to the image below:
							</p>
							<span class="image main"><img src="../images/Login Iterations.png" alt="" class="iterationBg" />
