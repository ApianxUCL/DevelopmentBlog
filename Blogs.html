									<h3>Setting Up</h3>

							<p><span class="image left"><img src="../images/startingOut.png" alt="" /></span>
								To kick off, we arranged a meeting with all group members out of hours. We set up 
							a Microsoft Teams group, a Github repository. We set up a Google Doc to track interactions 
							with the client. Having not received the project brief from UCL, we reached out 
							directly to our client, Apian, via email to try and get a project briefing and set up a call. 
							Apian was quick to respond and set up a meeting. As we did not have the project 
							briefing, we instead used the time to try and offload work down the line by asking 
							what the TAs what deliverables there would be within the project and working on 
							them. For example, we set up the portfolio blog in the first week. Additionally, 
							we attempted to preemptively write some questions for our client without the project 
							briefing as a formative thinking task. We used the client's website as inspiration for 
							the kind of questions we would ask. These questions were noted on the Google Doc.</p>
							
							<h3>Meeting Team Members and Discussing the Brief</h3>
							<p>
								During the meeting with group members that we arranged, we discussed our experiences, 
							our strengths and our weaknesses. We talked about this in the context of what roles and 
							what work we might want to take of the project.
							</p>
							<p>
								We later received the project briefing notes, a little in advance of our initial 
							meeting with Apian, using the briefing, we further refined our questions to ask questions 
							where there were gaps in understanding of the briefing or our knowledge. 
							</p>
							<p>
								The initial project briefing we received was as follows: Healthcare drone porter 
							interface, simulating porters around a hospital with multiple building sites, and can 
							make use of AirTags, BLE devices and other ways of beacon route finding. Design a 
							front end UI that is cross platform, as well as a SharePoint solution with equivalent 
							UI to do an A-B test for comparison of results. Mimicking the UCL buildings to begin 
							with will be a good starting point. Both packages should enable a hospital to plot 
							locations of porters, and issue requests to them via Twilio, demonstrate queue and 
							prioritisation of work, and integrate with other communication services.
							</p>
							<h3>Our final questions were:</h3>
							<p>
								Who exactly is going to use the application?
								<br>
								For the web application, is it going to be used on mobiles? Should we support mobiles, 
								have usable designs for them?
								<br>
								What BLE devices are we going to use for location tracking?
								<br>
								What is already done/implemented from Apian side? Mostly thinking about the 
								integration of our app into the existing system.
								<br>
								What criteria are going to be used to prioritise work? Who provides the information 
								on it?
								<br>
								How should emergencies be handled? Eg. What should the porter do if theyâ€™re in the 
								middle of a delivery? How to interrupt (or not) ongoing deliveries from technical 
								and from business side?
								<br>
								With regards to tracking porters in a multi story building, do you already have 
								a solution to this? We were thinking of using the porterâ€™s smartphone to find out 
								interior tracking and to know which floor the porters are in.
								<br>
								How can we track individual high priority assets and equipment? Is this within the 
								scope of the Apian? The alternative would be returning equipment to storage asap 
								after use and a porter to check if equipment is available in storage (slower)
								<br>

									<h3>The Client Meeting</h3>
								During our meeting with Apian, we asked the finalised questions that we wrote
							prior to the meeting. We received either answers or notes for follow up. These were noted in 
							the google Doc to log meetings that we created.</p>
							
							<h3>Answers to our previous questions</h3>
							<p>
								<h4>Who exactly is going to use the application?</h4>
								Estates & Facilities management staffwho organise, e.g. 
								porters and , helideck personnel and in some cases, transport 
								facilities, Laboratory staff, Pharmacy department staff
								<br>
								What are porters?
								<br>
								Porters are staff who move patients and equipment around the hospital.
								<br>

								<h4>For the web application, is it going to be used on mobiles? Should we support mobiles, 
								have usable designs for them?</h4>
								Both mobile and desktop. Should be web based and PWA for mobile. 
								<br>

								<h4>What BLE devices are we going to use for location tracking?</h4>
								UCL recommends Airtags; we could also use other BLE tags 
								Airtags can only emit a pinging sound. 
								To be confirmed and agreed upon after more research.
								<br>

								<h4>What is already done/implemented from Apian side? Mostly thinking about the 
								integration of our app into the existing system.</h4>
								Nothing.
								<br>
								<h4>
								What criteria are going to be used to prioritise work? Who provides the information 
								on it?</h4>
								<p></p>
								Further research is needed to determine how porter workload is currently prioritised. 
								A crash call that requires a porter to get blood packs for transfusion will always 
								take priority above anything else. 
								</p><p>
								Prioritisation criteria will be determined by medical need, incorporating:
								If sample is labelled as urgent or not by the clinician, required turnaround time 
								e.g. renal samples need to be delivered to a lab by 2pm to ensure same day results 
								vs another sample that can wait for next day delivery, time-related payload 
								constraints e.g. an item needs to be temperature controlled and the packaging 
								only can keep it at a certain temperature for X hrs so must be delivered before 
								the cold chain is breached.
								</p><p>
								Then we can add other layers such as: Prioritisation between samples and other 
								porter work, Travelling salesperson problem - should a lower priority item be 
								collected on the way to a higher priority item if timing is not significantly 
								affected?
								<br>
								Capacity of the drone (a lower priority item may fit in the next incoming 
								drone while a more urgent item can only fit in an empty drone thatâ€™s coming 
								in next) - this implies higher volume								
								</p>
								<h4>How should emergencies be handled? Eg. What should the porter do if theyâ€™re in the 
								middle of a delivery? How to interrupt (or not) ongoing deliveries from technical 
								and from business side?
								</h4>
								Further research is needed
								<br>
								<h4>With regards to tracking porters in a multi story building, do you already have 
								a solution to this? We were thinking of using the porterâ€™s smartphone to find out 
								interior tracking and to know which floor the porters are in.
								</h4>
								Further research is needed. Porters donâ€™t carry work liable smartphones.
								<br>
								<h4>How can we track individual high priority assets and equipment? Is this within the 
								scope of the Apian? The alternative would be returning equipment to storage asap 
								after use and a porter to check if equipment is available in storage (slower)
								</h4>
								Out of scope

										Following the client meeting, we wrote up requirements, which can be seen in the requirements
										section of the portfolio blog. In an attempt to try and refine our requirements further 
										we conducted market research. Having set up the relevant communication channels with 
										Apian such as Slack, WhatsApp and Email, we tried to confirm a tech stack with our client. 
										This involved investigating the pricings, discussing budgets and caveats with different 
										technologies and their competitors.
									<p>
										Knowing our client was working on a small budget, being a startup, we took a greater 
										focus on budget options for Bluetooth tracking and communication. For instance, we asked 
										the Computer Science help desk what BLE tracking devices they had available to help 
										direct our choices. Furthermore, we explored funding options from UCL, discussing and 
										writing emails to ask what UCL would be willing to fund. For example if UCL could fund a 
										premium firebase subscription.
									</p>
									<p>
										The potential tracking options we considered were, low power BLE beacons which many 
										companies sold. Options we saw included Aruba, Zebra, Moko Smart and many others. 
										We considered GPS, however we knew this might not be feasible for hospitals with 
										many floors especially in the basement for example, so it was decided that this 
										would be a last option. We also considered using bluetooth and GPS in combination 
										for more accurate tracking. 
										<br>
										At this stage, we could already foresee problems arising. For example, a group member who 
										had prior experience with bluetooth suggested that bluetooth may not be extremely accurate 
										due signal interferences and obstacles blocking signal such as a phone case, and walls, 
										particularly as many doors in hospitals are thick fire doors. 
									</p>
									<p>
										We knew that we would likely have to implement a mobile app for porters and a website for 
										administrators in the system. From discussing with Apian we knew that this was usually 
										specific people who assigned tasks to porters but could also be doctors themselves. 
										<br>
										From this we could tell that we needed to decide on a frontend framework, how to implement 
										the app and how to store data in the backend. Hosting would also need to be handled. 
										As we knew that we were using several different platforms (mobile and web) we immediately 
										knew that React Native was a safe bet due to its performant and cross platform nature. 
										Some of our members also had experience with React Native making it an excellent choice. 
										After discussion we felt that React native would also be a viable option for the mobile app 
										but soon realized the levels of permissions that would be needed would warrant an application 
										and a webpage would not suffice. 
										<br>
										Our client, Apian who had experience in the area also guided us to use create an Android app. 
										We decided that the app would be best written in Kotlin.
